<p>I agree with Kate Wagner's essay, "404 Page Not Found", on how the internet has evolved into a less than savory place when compared to what it once was because of big brands like Facebook, however, I do not agree that the bad things about the contemporary internet outweigh the good stuff. My reason for this is that I still believe that it helps to expand and spread communication between people worldwide in ways that the old internet couldn't, which for me is what the internet should be all about.</p>
