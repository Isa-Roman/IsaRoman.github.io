		<p> "Welcome to the T-D-I-C-E Organization! We are dedicated to the cause of tracking down the location of the dragons located in the center of the earth and we need your help! If you look through our website you will see the undeniable evidence of dragons living in the center of our earth and being the true reason behind global warming. After you finish exploring our website you'll be able to officially join our cause and become a member of the organization."</p>
		<p>"Scientists have argued and provided evidence that global warming is real and they are correct! But what they got wrong was the true reason behind global warming. In the center of the earth, the dragons have been repopulating, and now that they are at max capacity their fire is starting to heat the center of the earth at an alarming rate! This is the true cause behind global warming and we have an image of what we believe that looks like. It was created by our expert digital artist."</p>
