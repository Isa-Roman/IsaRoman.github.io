		<p> We do have one photo that had been taken some years ago in the middle of the night. If you look closely you can see what appears to be an infant dragon hiding in the background behind the tree! This alone should be enough proof that dragons are real.</p>

				<p>Scientists have argued and provided evidence that global warming is real and they are correct! But what they got wrong was the true reason behind global warming. In the center of the earth, the dragons have been repopulating, and now that they are at max capacity their fire is starting to heat the center of the earth at an alarming rate! This is the true cause behind global warming and we have an image of what we believe that looks like. It was created by our expert digital artist.</p>

	<p>Below is a video where they discuss more on hollow earth theory. Which helps to support our own theory on dragons living in the center of the Earth.</p>
