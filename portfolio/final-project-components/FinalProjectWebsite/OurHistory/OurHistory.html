<p>Welcome to the D-R-A-G-O-N  Organization! We are dedicated to the cause of tracking down the location of the dragons located in the center of the earth and we need your help! If you look through our website you will see the undeniable evidence of dragons living in the center of our earth and being the true reason behind global warming. After you finish exploring our website you’ll be able to officially join our cause and become a member of the organization.</p>

<p>We were originally founded by a man named, 
José Guapo and woman, Isabelle Diaz, though she left before the organization was officially established so we don’t count her. He saw the truth as the world around him changed and global warming was realized. Dragons are the cause behind just behind every natural disaster and because they live in the center of our earth! But of course no one would listen or believe him due to the dumb excuse that he lacked a college degree in everything, But he was determined and found more like minded people who saw the truth and helped to build this organization from the ground up. Though he’ll never get to see the day when we finally do reach the center of the earth you still can!
